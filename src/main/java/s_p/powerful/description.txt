This examples demonstrates that several things can be handled in a flexible way and can be extended easily without changing the interface/api.
The calculation method takes an interface to retrieve the static life expectancy. This can be exchanged easily by passing another object that also implements the same interface.
A context object is used to add additional calculation relevant details. This can also be changed without changing the signature of the calculation method.
An object for personal attributes is introduced to delegate one part of the calculation to mandatory subclasses like a woman or a man that can have several individual 
attributes that have effect on their life expectancy.
