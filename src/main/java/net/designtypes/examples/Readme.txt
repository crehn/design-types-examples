 - Start with library then read on.
 - Note that all solutions are idealistic: simple+idealistic, powerful+idealistic, etc. Pragmatic solutions will be

ToDo:
 - abstract
 - concrete
 - check for wrong imports
 - throw InsureeNotFoundException
 - birthday ==> dateOfBirth is better 
 - include height and weight
