 - REST is a great new technology.
 - Lombok is great! How can you bear having all that clutter in you code!
 - Logging is done by an interceptor and a servlet filter. The servlet filter was first then the interceptor was 
   introduced. There is no particular need for the servlet filter anymore. On the other hand: it has the advantage that
   it directly logs the HTTP request. That's slightly better in some cases so leave both.
 
 
ToDo:
 - A technologic guy would certainly use Java8 if possible
 - Include swagger?
